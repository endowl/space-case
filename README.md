Fleek SpaceSDK identity management and file sharing demo.

This app creats and manages Fleek user identities using the Fleek SpaceSDK.  We incorporated the Moon Cat Rescue library to generate unique "identicats", created by parsing each user's public keys to produce easily recognizable icons.

A File Manager allows users to upload and organize their files on Fleeks storage infrastructure.

A contact list allows for keeping track of friend's accounts, again using "identicats" to make it easy to identify the correct account.

User's are able to select and share files with each other thanks to the Fleek SpaceSDK.

In a future version we will add inter-user messaging as well.
